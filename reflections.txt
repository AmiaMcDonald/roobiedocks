Your response goes here! I learned how to use code to mark up an articles using different syntaxes. I found it to be difficult and had a personal 1 to 1 with Sarah.
Unfortunately none of it did I understand initially but  I had a wonderful instructure.
Although I used problem solving strategies, they were very helpful.
